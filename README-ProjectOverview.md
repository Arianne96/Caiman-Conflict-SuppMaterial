# Project Summary 
we explored the importance of understanding current attitudes towards the presence of black caiman populations.
We surveyed four villages situated along the Rupununi River in the North Rupununi Guyana. 
Our analysis indicates that negative attitudes are heavily influenced by seasonality, gender, and village.
Our results offer additional insights into human wildlife interactions and the dynamics of living alongside a protected large predator in Guyana, South America.
